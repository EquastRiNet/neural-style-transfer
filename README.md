# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer

> **AI model that blends the style of one image (the style image) into the contents of another image (the content image).**

## 🎨 Demo: Style Transfer in Action!

| **Content Image** | **Style Image** | **Stylized Result** |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|
| ![Content](content_image/main_content.jpg) | ![Style](style_image/mosaic.jpg) | ![Result](final_images/style_bg_mosaic.png) |

## 🚀 Features

- Blend any two images to create stunning artwork
- Fully implemented in Jupyter Notebook
- Easy to use and customize

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EquastRiNet/neural-style-transfer.git
```

---

## ✨ Usage

Open the main Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
Neural_Style_Transfer_Original.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to:

1. Upload your **content** and **style** images
2. Run the cells to generate your own stylized masterpiece
3. Save and share your results!

## 🖌️ How It Works

> The model uses deep neural networks to extract the *content* from one image and the *style* from another, blending them into a new, unique image.
